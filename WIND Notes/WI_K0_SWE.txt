USE OF THE QUALITY VARIABLES: 
*** Good data is indicated by a quality flag of 0. ***
The quality flags for each parameter are given as integers 4 bytes 
long (integer*4).  The individual 'bits' for each quality value are set 
(or cleared) in the analysis code by adding (or subtracting) a power of 
2 as follows: 

To set the 1st bit, add 1. 
To set the 2nd bit, add 2, 
To set the 3rd bit, add 4, 
To set the 4th bit, add 8, and so on. 
    BIT  TO_SET_BIT     MEANING 
    1    +1         = 3 point parabolic fits to proton peaks were not attempted.
    2    +2         = non-linear least squares fit was not attempted. 
    3    +4         = 3 point parabolic fits to proton peaks FAILED. 
    4    +8         = non-linear least squares fit FAILED.
