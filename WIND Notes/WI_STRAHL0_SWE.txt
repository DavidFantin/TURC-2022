Notes:
The 2D electron angular distributions included in this data set were measured by
the Wind/SWE strahl detector (see Ogilvie et al., "SWE, a comprehensive plasma
instrument for the Wind spacecraft", Space Sci. Rev., 71, 55, 1995).
Each angular distribution was measured at a single electron energy. The energy
was selected by applying a voltage between the electrostatic analyzer plates.
The detector sampled 32 energies between 19 eV and 1238 eV, and during normal
operation would sweep through these energies one at a time with approximately 12
second cadence.
The instrument's 12 anodes are set in a vertical pattern in a plane that
contains the spacecraft spin axis, spanning a field of view +/-28 degrees
centered around the ecliptic (with uneven angular spacing between anodes).
Wind's spin axis is set at a right angle with the ecliptic plane, allowing
different azimuthal angles to be sampled as the spacecraft spins (3 sec spin
period). These azimuthal bins have a fixed separation of 3.53 degrees. Each
strahl (and antistrahl) distribution measured by the spacecraft consists of a
14x12 angular grid of electron counts, that was measured at a fixed energy
during a single spacecraft spin. Counts are converted into physical units of f
(v) (e.g., cm^-6s^3) in the standard fashion by accounting for the detector
efficiency and geometric factor.
The data set reported here contains: f_strahl, f_antistrahl, f_strahl_counts,
f_antistrahl_counts, phi_strahl, phi_antistrahl, theta, energy.
