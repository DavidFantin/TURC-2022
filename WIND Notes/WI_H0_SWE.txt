Notes:
The electron moments included in this data set are derived from the velocity
moments integration of solar wind electron distributions measured by the
WIND/SWE VEIS instrument (see Ogilvie et al., "SWE, a comprehensive plasma
instrument for the WIND spacecraft", Space Sci. Rev., 71, 55, 1955). Moments
parameters are computed from 3s measurements which are spaced either 6s or 12s
in time.  Plots should therefore not exceed a time range of 2 or 3 hours in
order to display the details of this high resolution data.  The moments
parameters which will be of value to most users of this data set are the
electron temperature, the electron temperature anisotropy, and the electron heat
flux vector. These quantities are reliable and citable with caution, meaning
that the PI advises that the user should discuss their interpretation with a
member of the SWE science team before publishing. 
The following comments are intended to aid in the use and interpretation of the
prime quantities of this data set, the electron temperature, the electron
temperature anisotropy, and the electron heat flux. (All vector quantities are
in GSE coordinates.) The temperature and temperature anisotropy are normalized
to the derived electron density and, therefore, are not sensitive to  the
uncertainty in the density determination as discussed below. The electron
temperature is derived from the pressure tensor divided by the electron density
and the Boltzmann constant. The three eigenvalues of the diagonalized
temperature tensor are the temperature parallel to the tensor principal axis and
the two perpendicular components of the temperature. The temperature anisotropy
is defined here as the ratio of the parallel temperature to the average of the
two perpendicular temperature components. The electron temperature is one-third
of the trace of the diagonalized temperature
tensor. Also included is the unit vector along the principal axis of the
pressure tensor as well as the cosine of the angle between the principal axis
and the magnetic field vector. An indication that the principal axis has been
uniquely defined is that the temperature anisotropy is significantly different
from unity and that the principal axis and the magnetic field are nearly
parallel or anti-parallel.
The heat flux vector included here is significant only when the magnitude rises
above the noise level, i.e., above the level 0.002 to 0.005 ergs/cm/cm/s.  The
heat flux may be low in magnitude either due to a nearly isotropic distribution,
due to electron counter-streaming, or due to a  low counting rate of the
instrument. An indicator of a significant net heat flux is that the heat flux
direction should track with the magnetic field direction. For this purpose, the
cosine of the angle between the heat flux vector and the magnetic field is
included, and should be close to  -1 or  +1 in order for the heat flux to be
significant. In some cases it will be necessary to use electron pitch angle
distributions (available on request from the SWE team) to decide whether low
electron flux or counterstreaming account for a low net heat flux. It is also
strongly recommended that 3s magnetic field data from the WIND/MFI experiment
(not included in this data set) be used in
conjunction with the SWE electron heat flux data to ensure a correct
interpretation of the heat flux.
The electron density and electron bulk flow velocity are also included in this
data set but no claim is made for their accuracy. The electron flow velocity is
usually within 10% to 20% of the solar wind flow velocity derived from the SWE
Faraday cup experiment and which are found in the SWE key parameter data set.
The electron density, however,  cannot be absolutely determined due to the
spacecraft potential and the fact that the electron instrument response has
varied over time. The electron density determination includes a first order
attempt to determine the spacecraft potential by imposing the charge neutrality
condition on the derived electron density and Faraday cup ion density. The
electron density will be within a few percent of the solar wind density derived
from the Faraday cup early in the mission (1994-1997), while later in the
mission (1998 and onward), depending on the state of the instrument,  there will
be times when the derived electron density
may be as much as a factor 2 too low. Although the electron density is not
derived absolutely, relative changes in electron density can usually be relied
on. Both the electron density and electron flow speed track with variations in
the ion density and ion flow speed, respectively. However, the user is strongly
advised to use the SWE ion key parameters for the bulk plasma density and flow
speed.
