Notes:
The electron moments included in this data set are derived from quadrature
integration of the solar wind electron distributions (w/ some fitting) measured
by the Wind/SWE electron instrument (see Ogilvie et al., "SWE, a comprehensive
plasma instrument for the Wind spacecraft", Space Sci. Rev., 71, 55, 1955).
Moments parameters are computed from 9s measurements which are usually separated
by one or more 3s spin-periods. These quantities are reliable and citable with
caution, meaning that the PI advises that the user should discuss their
interpretations with a member of the SWE science team before publishing.
The following comments are intended to aid in the use and interpretation of the
prime quantities of this data set, the electron density, bulk-velocity and
temperature.  We compensate for the limited nature of our observations under
this instrument mode by combining electron observations with bulk-velocity
estimates derived from corresponding ion observations.  The (13) energy channels
over which observations are made are: E = 19.34, 38.68, 58.03, 77.37, 96.71,
116.1, 193.4, 290.1, 425.5, 580.3, 773.7, 1006., and 1238. eV; f(E,Az,El)
[#/{cc*(cm/s)^3}] being obtained for each E, using an 8x6 grid of
look-directions (Azimuth x Elevation, with ~45x9 deg. "pixels")--thus
constituting an 'electron distribution'. 
A fitted Maxwellian model supplements the "core" regime of each distribution. 
N_elec [#/cc] gives the density value derived for the full distribution, while
NcElec [#/cc] gives that of the core.  U_eGSE and UceGSE [km/s, GSE], resp.
supply the full and core bulk-velocity.  P_eGSE [erg/cc, GSE] has the [Pxx, Pxy,
Pxz, Pyy, Pyz, Pzz] components of the derived pressure-tensor.  T_elec and
TcElec [K], resp. provide the full and core total-temperatures; W_elec and
WcElec [eV] specifying the corresponding thermal-energies.  Te_pal, Te_per,
TecPal and TecPer [K] give resp. full and core parallel- and
perpendicular-temperatures (wrt B), with Te_ani and TecAni [unitless] furnishing
the perpendicular/parallel temperature-anisotropies for each regime.  Finally,
Gyrtrp [unitless] indicates the derived electron gyrotropy.
The data set reported here contains: N_elec, NcElec, U_eGSE, UceGSE, P_eGSE,
T_elec, TcElec, W_elec, WcElec, Te_pal, Te_per, TecPal, TecPer, Te_ani, TecAni,
and Gyrtrp (as described above).
